								      	Cillín had a goal every week to sell a certain amount of shoes. Every 
								      	week his sale target was met and one week he made over €400 than his target.
								      	He enjoyed the challenge of trying to get every customer he met to not leave 
								      	the shop without making a purchase. He was often given the task of doing 
								      	security work for the shop. This gave him a lot of responsibility on his 
								      	shoulders as he was the only security in the shop and it would get very busy 
								      	around the Christmas period. On one occasion he caught a woman shop lifting 
								     	and retained the products stolen.

							      	LiftBoy is a very popular Automation Gate company and Linktooling is a 
							      	company that sells injected pin, screws etc, within Liftboy. In the short 
							      	time Cillín worked here he had many responsibilities and duties. His main 
							      	being to use Microsoft Office to make brochures, posters and presentations. 
							 		<br>
							     	This job was great for improving Cillíns communication skills. There wasn't 
							      	a day that went by where he wouldn't talk to a client or company either in 
							      	person or over the phone. He also had a lot of manual jobs like going onto 
							      	sites to hang gates with his manager, program remotes for customers, fix machines 
							      	in the showroom. These jobs involved a lot of talking to the clients and 
							      	understanding the problem at hand.

							      	drinks using serving methods and techniques thought to him by management staff.

							      	Cillín really enjoyed the atmosphere at the races and the social side to 
							      	this job. Each weekend he would be working in a different area of this complex. 
							      	Most of his time here he worked behind a bar making drinks, collecting glasses, 
							      	clearing 
							      	tables etc. He often would have to work in a restaurant setting tables to a 
							      	high standard, serving dinners, and cleaning dishes. On several occasions he 
							      	worked in private suites. Here he would be a personal bartender/waiter for the 
							      	owner of the suite, attending to all of their needs.
