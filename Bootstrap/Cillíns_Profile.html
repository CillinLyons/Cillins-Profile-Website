						Cillín is 21 years old as of last month and currently lives in Booterstown Co. Dublin. Cillín is now in his 4th year 
						of college in D.I.T Kevin street, studying computer science infrastructure. Cilln is originally from Clondawkin in Dublin but has also 
						lived in Sallins Co. Kildare, Kildangan Co. Kildare and Athgarvan Co. Kildare. There are five relatives in Cillíns family. He has one 
						older sister who is a nurse and a younger brother who is a rugby fanatic. He also has 3 pugs called Lilly, Rufus and Lola. 
						
						<br><br>
						
						In his sixth year of secondary school Cillín thought long and hard about what he wanted to study in college. He was unsure what he wanted 
						to do for a very long time until a spokesperson for waterford I.T visited his school and talked about computer courses. Cillín didn't have 
						much experience or knowledge about computers, but he was very interested in the idea. So he put computing down as his first choice on his 
						CAO and fortunately got it. In his 3rd year of college Cillín was awarded a scholarship to Korea. This was his first time leaving Europe, 
						but he really enjoyed a successful semester over there. Cilln intends on travelling after he finishes his course. He hopes to work in the 
						United States for a few years and then take a year out to travel around each continent of the world and
